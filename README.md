### Advent of Code 2024

Just general notes as I go.

#### Day 1 & 2

**Decided to use `deno`**, first time playing with it in a long time and the builtin in watcher and test runner (although I haven't needed it yet) is really cool.

Disabled copilot mid through day 2 as it felt like cheating and it was actually annoying me â€“ I actually screwed up because it messed up the for loop for part 2.
